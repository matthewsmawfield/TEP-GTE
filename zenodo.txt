Analysis of 25.3 years of GNSS timing data (2000–2025) reveals a persistent, distance-structured correlation in global atomic clock networks that tests an empirically untested assumption of general relativity: the global integrability of proper time. Examination of 165.2 million station pairs from 474 unique receivers demonstrates a spatial correlation signal decaying exponentially with distance (λ = 4,201 ± 1,967 km, R² = 0.92–0.97 across three independent analysis centers).

This integrated manuscript synthesizes results from a systematic five-paper research program: theoretical framework development with quantitative predictions (Paper 0), multi-center validation across independent processing pipelines (Paper 1), 25-year longitudinal analysis enabling long-period geophysical detection (Paper 2), raw data confirmation eliminating processing artifacts (Paper 3), and cosmological extension connecting terrestrial correlations to dark matter phenomenology (Paper 4).

Seven Statistically Independent Signatures (joint probability p ≈ 2×10⁻²⁷, >10σ):
1. Exponential spatial decay: λ = 4,201 ± 1,967 km
2. Spatial anisotropy: EW/NS ratio = 2.16 (p < 10⁻¹⁵)
3. Orbital velocity coupling: r = −0.888 (5.1σ)
4. CMB frame alignment: 18.2° from dipole (5,570× variance ratio over galactic motion)
5. Planetary event responses: 56/156 significant at ≥2σ (2.8× above null rate)
6. 18.6-year lunar nutation coupling: R² = 0.641
7. Semiannual nutation coupling: R² = 0.904

Raw RINEX validation using Single Point Positioning with broadcast ephemerides achieves 100% detection rate across 72 metric combinations (t-statistics up to 112, Cohen's d up to 0.304), excluding processing artifacts as the origin. The network's selectivity profile—sensitive to velocity-dependent dynamics while blind to GM/r² scaling and solar rotation—characterizes it as an inertial interferometer measuring correlation geometry rather than a gravimeter measuring Newtonian force.

These observations match a priori predictions of the Temporal Equivalence Principle, a bi-metric scalar-tensor framework in which proper time is a dynamical field governed by a conformal factor A(φ) = exp(2βφ/Mₚₗ). The observed correlation length corresponds to a scalar field mass mφ ≈ (4.34–5.93)×10⁻¹⁴ eV/c², consistent with Vainshtein screening at the dark energy scale Λ ~ 10⁻¹³ eV. The framework preserves local Lorentz invariance while predicting global path-dependent synchronization. Critically, the conformal sector responsible for clock-rate modulation remains unconstrained by GW170817, which bounds only disformal (cone-tilting) effects.

Explicit Falsification Criteria:
- Failure of independent groups to replicate the raw carrier-phase signal
- Correlation length outside λ = 500–20,000 km range
- SLR residuals showing no distance-structured correlation (ephemeris loophole)
- Null synchronization holonomy at 10⁻¹⁹ precision (triangle test)
- Resolution of S₈ tension through conventional mechanisms
