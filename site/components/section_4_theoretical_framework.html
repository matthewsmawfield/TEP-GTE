<h1>4. Theoretical Framework</h1>

<p>
    Having established that the signal is robust and not attributable to known artifacts, this section presents the theoretical framework that predicted these observations. The Temporal Equivalence Principle is a principled extension of general relativity within the well-established class of scalar-tensor theories, with specific quantitative predictions that preceded the GNSS analysis.
</p>

<h2>4.1 Two-Metric Geometry</h2>

<p>
    TEP posits that spacetime is endowed with two metrics related by a scalar field φ:
</p>

<div class="equation">
    $$\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} = A(\phi)\, g_{\mu\nu} + B(\phi)\, \nabla_\mu \phi\, \nabla_\nu \phi$$
</div>

<p>
    The gravitational metric g<sub>μν</sub> determines geodesics of test masses and gravitational wave propagation. The matter metric g̃<sub>μν</sub> determines atomic clock rates, electromagnetic propagation, and all Standard Model physics. The conformal factor A(φ) = exp(2βφ/M<sub>Pl</sub>) provides isotropic rescaling of proper time, while the disformal factor B(φ) introduces anisotropic light-cone tilts and is tightly constrained by GW170817.
</p>

<p>
    This structure belongs to the well-established class of scalar-tensor theories developed by Bekenstein (1993) and Damour & Polyakov (1994). The contribution of TEP lies in its operational interpretation: the conformal factor A(φ) governs the rate at which proper time accumulates, rendering time itself a dynamical field.
</p>

<h2>4.2 Physical Interpretation</h2>

<p>
    The framework is formulated as a scalar-tensor theory in the Einstein frame where gravity remains canonical. The scalar field φ couples to matter through the conformal factor A(φ), modulating the rate of proper time accumulation. The coupling strength is parameterized by β ~ 10<sup>−3</sup>, weak enough to evade existing constraints yet strong enough to produce observable GNSS correlations. The scalar field obeys a Klein-Gordon equation with source terms from matter density and a screening potential V(φ) that suppresses fifth forces in dense environments. (Full action and field equations are provided in Appendix A.)
</p>

<h2>4.3 Foundational Axioms</h2>

<p>
    The framework rests on four axioms. The first (two-metric structure) states that gravity is described by g<sub>μν</sub> while matter couples universally to g̃<sub>μν</sub>. The second (temporal equivalence) states that all non-gravitational processes evolve according to proper time dτ defined by g̃<sub>μν</sub>, and that in local freely falling frames, physics reduces to special relativity with invariant c. The third (causal safety) requires that c<sub>g</sub> = c<sub>γ</sub> within GW170817 bounds (|c<sub>g</sub> − c<sub>γ</sub>|/c ≲ 10<sup>−15</sup>), constraining B(φ) to be negligible at late times. The fourth (screening) posits a chameleon-like potential V(φ) that yields density-dependent effective mass, screening fifth forces in dense environments while permitting cosmological dynamics.
</p>

<h2>4.4 Compton Energy Scale</h2>

<p>
    The observed correlation length λ corresponds to a specific scalar field mass via the Compton relation λ = ℏ/(m<sub>φ</sub>c). For λ = 3,330–4,549 km, the effective field mass is:
</p>

<div class="equation">
    $$m_\phi \approx (4.34\text{--}5.93) \times 10^{-14}\, \text{eV}/c^2$$
</div>

<p>
    This mass scale is consistent with environmental screening mechanisms where the effective field mass varies with local matter density. The apparent inconsistency with existing precision tests—which are typically sensitive to scales around 10<sup>−15</sup> eV/c²—is resolved by screening: the field mass increases in dense environments where most precision tests are conducted, while remaining at the observed value in the sparse terrestrial environment sampled by the GNSS network.
</p>

<h3>4.4.1 Vainshtein Screening and the Terrestrial Correlation Length</h3>

<p>
    The Vainshtein mechanism provides a quantitative explanation for the observed GNSS correlation length. Derivative self-interactions in the scalar field Lagrangian (cubic Galileon terms) generate nonlinear screening that suppresses fifth forces near massive objects. The screening radius r<sub>V</sub> scales as:
</p>

<div class="equation">
    $$r_V = \left(\frac{GM}{\Lambda^3}\right)^{1/3}$$
</div>

<p>
    This M<sup>1/3</sup> scaling is universal, applying from planetary to galactic masses without additional free parameters. For Earth with M = M<sub>⊕</sub> ≈ 6 × 10<sup>24</sup> kg and taking Λ ~ 10<sup>−13</sup> eV (the dark energy scale, consistent with cosmological observations):
</p>

<div class="equation">
    $$r_V \sim \left(\frac{G \times 6 \times 10^{24}\text{ kg}}{(10^{-13}\text{ eV})^3}\right)^{1/3} \approx 4{,}000\text{ km}$$
</div>

<p>
    This prediction matches the observed GNSS correlation length λ = 4,201 ± 1,967 km with no adjustable parameters. The physical mechanism operates as follows:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Inside r<sub>V</sub>:</strong> Nonlinear derivative interactions dominate, screening the scalar field and suppressing fifth forces. The effective coupling to matter is reduced by factors of (r/r<sub>V</sub>)<sup>3</sup>, rendering TEP effects undetectable in laboratory tests and solar system observations.</li>
    <li><strong>Outside r<sub>V</sub>:</strong> The scalar field becomes weakly coupled and mediates long-range correlations. Clock networks sampling this region detect the φ-field structure through spatial covariance.</li>
    <li><strong>Transition scale:</strong> The correlation length λ ~ r<sub>V</sub> marks the boundary where screening becomes ineffective, allowing the scalar field's influence to manifest.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Falsifiable Predictions:</strong> The M<sup>1/3</sup> scaling law makes specific predictions for intermediate-mass systems:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Jupiter</strong> (M ~ 300 M<sub>⊕</sub>): Predicted λ<sub>Jupiter</sub> ~ (300)<sup>1/3</sup> × 4,000 km ≈ 27,000 km. Testable with Juno mission clock data or future Jupiter atmospheric probe networks.</li>
    <li><strong>Globular clusters</strong> (M ~ 10<sup>5</sup> M<sub>☉</sub>): Predicted screening length ~ 1–10 pc, testable through pulsar timing array correlations within clusters.</li>
    <li><strong>Galaxies</strong> (M ~ 10<sup>12</sup> M<sub>☉</sub>): Predicted r<sub>V</sub> ~ 50 kpc, matching the observed dark matter halo radius. This connection is developed in Section 5.5.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The Vainshtein mechanism thus provides a unified explanation spanning 15 orders of magnitude in mass scale, from Earth to galaxy clusters, with a single fundamental parameter Λ set by cosmological observations.
</p>

<h2>4.5 Synchronization Holonomy and Spatial Correlations</h2>

<p>
    TEP predicts synchronization holonomy—the non-closure of proper time when transported around a closed loop:
</p>

<div class="equation">
    $$\mathcal{H} \equiv \oint_C d\tau_{\text{prop}} \neq 0$$
</div>

<p>
    In standard general relativity, after subtracting known effects (Sagnac, Shapiro, gravitational redshift), this holonomy vanishes. In TEP with disformal coupling B ≠ 0, it does not.
</p>

<p>
    An important subtlety arises in the conformal-only limit (B = 0): the time-transport one-form Ω<sub>μ</sub> = ∂<sub>μ</sub>(½ ln A) is exact, its curl vanishes, and holonomy is zero. Nonzero holonomy requires non-exact structure from disformal couplings or more general non-metricity. This raises a question: if GW170817 constrains B(φ) to be negligible, and conformal coupling alone produces no holonomy, what generates the observed GNSS correlations?
</p>

<p>
    The resolution lies in distinguishing two observables. Synchronization holonomy (H) represents the non-closure of proper time around closed loops; this requires B ≠ 0 and is the target of proposed triangle tests. Spatial correlation structure, by contrast, represents the statistical covariance of clock residuals as a function of distance; this arises from the spatial structure of the φ field itself—specifically, the two-point correlation function ⟨φ(x)φ(x+r)⟩ ∝ exp(−r/λ)—and persists even when B = 0.
</p>

<p>
    The GNSS signal reflects the latter mechanism: clocks at different locations sample different values of the conformal factor A(φ), and spatial correlations in φ induce correlations in clock rates. The exponential decay with distance reflects the Compton wavelength of the screened scalar field, while the velocity-dependent anisotropy arises because Earth's motion through the φ field creates a preferred direction in the correlation structure. The correlation structure is thus a statistical signature of the φ field's spatial configuration, whereas holonomy is a geometric signature of non-integrable time transport. Both are predictions of TEP, but they probe different aspects of the framework and have different observational requirements.
</p>

<h3>4.5.1 Resolving the Conformal Paradox</h3>

    <figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-top: 10px; padding: 0 20px;">
        <strong>Figure 1:</strong> Synchronization Holonomy: The Definitive Test of Non-Integrable Proper Time. Three atomic clocks (A, B, C) positioned at vertices of a triangle (1,000–3,000 km separation) exchange one-way time-transfer pulses around the loop. Panel A (Standard GR): After subtracting all known relativistic effects (Sagnac, Shapiro, gravitational redshift, Lense-Thirring), the accumulated time difference returns to zero—proper time is integrable. Panel B (TEP): A residual time gap ℋ<sub>resid</sub> ~ 10<sup>−18</sup>–10<sup>−16</sup> s remains, scaling as (B/A)|∇φ|² · Area. Target sensitivity: σ(ℋ)/T<sub>loop</sub> ≤ 10<sup>−19</sup>.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    A critical objection must be addressed: if TEP employs only a conformal coupling A(φ), how can it produce synchronization holonomy? In standard differential geometry, a conformal transformation preserves angles and therefore cannot generate path-dependent effects in closed loops. The resolution lies in distinguishing synchronization holonomy from spatial correlation structure.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Observable 1: Synchronization Holonomy (ℋ)</strong> — The non-closure of proper time around closed loops, defined as ℋ ≡ ∮<sub>C</sub> dτ<sub>prop</sub>. This observable requires B(φ) ≠ 0 (disformal coupling) because only non-exact structure in the time-transport connection generates path-dependent accumulation. In the conformal-only limit (B = 0), the one-form Ω<sub>μ</sub> = ∂<sub>μ</sub>(½ ln A) is exact, its curl vanishes identically, and holonomy is zero by Stokes' theorem. The triangle holonomy test (Section 6.3.3) targets this observable and will definitively measure whether B(φ) is nonzero at the 10<sup>−19</sup> fractional level.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Observable 2: Spatial Correlation Structure (C(r))</strong> — The statistical covariance of clock frequency residuals as a function of inter-station distance. This observable requires only A(φ) ≠ 1 (conformal coupling) and persists even when B = 0. The mechanism is fundamentally different from holonomy: clocks at different spatial locations sample different values of the scalar field φ(x), and the two-point correlation function ⟨φ(x)φ(x+r)⟩ ∝ exp(−r/λ) of the underlying field induces correlations in clock rates through the conformal factor A(φ) = exp(2βφ/M<sub>Pl</sub>). The exponential decay length λ = ℏ/(m<sub>φ</sub>c) reflects the Compton wavelength of the screened scalar field.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Physical Analogy:</strong> Consider a field of thermometers distributed across a landscape measuring a temperature field T(x) that varies spatially due to underground thermal sources. Even in the absence of heat flow (analogous to B = 0), nearby thermometers show correlated readings because they sample similar temperature values. The correlation length reflects the spatial structure of the temperature field itself, not thermal transport between locations. Similarly, GNSS clocks sample the φ-field "temperature," and their correlation structure reveals the field's spatial configuration.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Why GW170817 Does Not Constrain the GNSS Signal:</strong> The multi-messenger constraint |c<sub>γ</sub> − c<sub>g</sub>|/c ≲ 10<sup>−15</sup> bounds the disformal sector B(φ), which affects propagation speeds. The GNSS correlation structure arises from the conformal sector A(φ), which affects clock rates but preserves null cones. These are distinct physical effects constrained by different observables. GW170817 tells us that light and gravity travel at the same speed; it does not constrain whether clocks at different locations tick at correlated rates due to sampling a common scalar field.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Observational Distinction:</strong> The GNSS signal is a "thermometer correlation"—a statistical signature of φ-field structure detected through spatial covariance analysis. Holonomy is a "transport non-closure"—a geometric signature requiring closed-loop, one-way time transfer. Both are TEP predictions, but they probe different sectors (conformal vs. disformal) and require different experimental geometries (distributed networks vs. closed triangles). The present work establishes the former; the latter awaits dedicated triangle tests.
</p>

<h2>4.6 Prediction Comparison</h2>

        </tr>

</table>

<p>
    The null prediction regarding GM/r² scaling is particularly discriminating. Classical tidal forcing would produce mass-dependent signatures scaling with GM/r³, with Mercury contributing far less than Jupiter. The observed absence of such scaling (all p > 0.5 across multiple metrics) persists across both CODE network-adjusted products and raw RINEX data processed with RTKLIB Single Point Positioning. Since SPP processes each station independently without network adjustment or common-mode filtering, the persistence of the null in SPP data rules out the hypothesis that the absence of mass scaling is merely a processing artifact. The TEP coupling appears to be intrinsically geometric rather than energetic—responding to alignment configuration regardless of mass. Mercury (42.5% detection rate) produces comparable responses to Jupiter (34.8%) despite ~10<sup>6</sup>× smaller gravitational influence, consistent with a threshold-dependent or alignment-driven mechanism rather than continuous force scaling.

<h2>4.7 Why Existing Tests Do Not Constrain TEP</h2>

    Existing precision tests probe different observables than TEP's primary signatures, as summarized in Table 4.

        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>
    The critical distinction is that existing tests probe two-way or pairwise measurements, whereas TEP's holonomy is a closed-loop, one-way observable to which these tests are structurally blind. Two-way measurements probe reciprocal paths where holonomy cancels by symmetry; pairwise clock comparisons measure local potential differences but cannot detect non-integrability, which requires closed loops. TEP effects are therefore structurally invisible to these geometries, explaining why decades of precision tests found nothing amiss while the signal was present in GNSS residuals.
</p>

<div class="inset-box">
    <h4>Operational Measurement Protocol: What Existing Tests Probe</h4>
    
    <p>
        The distinction between observables that constrain TEP and those that do not can be formalized through the synchronization holonomy (after GR subtraction), where σ is the time-transport one-form whose line integral equals the calibrated proper-time increment along a leg:
    </p>
    
    <div class="equation">
        $$\mathcal{H}_{\text{resid}} = \oint_{\partial\Sigma} (\tilde{\sigma} - \sigma_{\text{GR}}) = \iint_{\Sigma} (\tilde{F} - F_{\text{GR}})$$
    </div>
    
    <p>
        This represents the loop non-closure of time transport built from measured proper times (in time units; right-hand rule on Σ). It is gauge and synchronization-invariant and vanishes in standard relativity and in the conformal-only limit of TEP. GR subtraction includes Sagnac, Lense-Thirring gravito-magnetic effects, Shapiro delay, and gravitational redshift, with ITRF ephemerides and TT/TDB standards.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        How flagship constraints map to ℋ<sub>resid</sub>:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>GW170817 (GW-EM coincidence): |c<sub>γ</sub> − c<sub>g</sub>|/c ≲ 10<sup>−15</sup> constrains global cone splits. In TEP, late-time conformal coupling preserves null cones, so electromagnetic and gravitational waves share causal structure; small disformal tilts today are allowed. This is a boundary condition, not a loop-holonomy test.</li>
        <li>Cassini (PPN-γ): Two-way Doppler/Shapiro is reciprocity-even; it calibrates σ<sub>GR</sub> to subtract but does not bound ℋ<sub>resid</sub>.</li>
        <li>Resonator MM/KT tests: Cavities bound closed-path, even-parity (two-way sums) anisotropy at 10<sup>−17</sup>–10<sup>−18</sup>, yet are blind to odd-parity (direction-reversing one-way differences) non-reciprocity and loop non-closure—the ingredients of ℋ<sub>resid</sub>.</li>
        <li>GPS operation: Network self-consistency uses explicit GR+Sagnac modeling and largely two-way/common-view calibration. This verifies internal consistency under the assumed GR model; it is not a direction-reversing one-way loop-closure null.</li>
        <li>Clock redshift and pairwise A↔B tests: Exquisitely confirm GR locally; only closed loops (A→B→C→A with direction reversal) can reveal non-integrability captured by ℋ<sub>resid</sub>.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        Why classical tests can be null while ℋ<sub>resid</sub> ≠ 0: (1) Conformal null-cone invariance implies no large GW-EM kinematic delays (consistent with GW170817). (2) If ∂<sub>t</sub>φ = 0 over loop timescale and gradients are conservative, there is no first-order one-way anisotropy. Along a fixed path, forward and backward times cancel at order (B,∇φ); leading effects are second order or require time dependence and kinematics. Thus two-way and closed-path nulls can hold while a loop-holonomy test remains sensitive.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Experimental falsifier (primary endpoints): Run a closed-loop, one-way time-transfer (and/or portable-clock) test and report: (1) Leg-wise antisymmetry: Δt<sub>AB</sub> = t<sub>AB</sub> − t<sub>BA</sub> (and optionally Ξ<sub>AB</sub> ≡ (t<sub>AB</sub> − t<sub>BA</sub>)/(t<sub>AB</sub> + t<sub>BA</sub>)). (2) Loop holonomy ℋ<sub>resid</sub> after subtracting GR (Sagnac/gravito-magnetic/Shapiro). Use triangle/quadrilateral geometries with direction reversal; extend with interplanetary one-way links and multi-species clock networks.

<h3>4.7.1 Compatibility with Binary Pulsar Timing and Lunar Laser Ranging</h3>

<p>
    Two high-precision tests warrant explicit discussion: binary pulsar timing (PSR J0737-3039, testing GR to 0.05%) and Lunar Laser Ranging (testing the equivalence principle to 10<sup>−13</sup>). Both are compatible with TEP through screening and universal coupling.
</p>

<p>
    Binary Pulsar Timing: The Hulse-Taylor pulsar PSR B1913+16 and the double pulsar PSR J0737-3039 provide exquisite tests of general relativity through orbital decay measurements. The observed orbital period derivatives match GR predictions to better than 0.05%, constraining deviations in the strong-field regime. TEP compatibility requires that scalar field effects are screened in the vicinity of neutron stars.
</p>

<p>
    The Vainshtein screening radius for a neutron star (M ~ 1.4 M<sub>☉</sub>) is:
</p>

<div class="equation">
    $$r_V^{\text{NS}} \sim \left(\frac{GM_{\text{NS}}}{\Lambda^3}\right)^{1/3} \sim 10^4 \text{ km}$$
</div>

<p>
    This screening radius far exceeds the neutron star radius (R<sub>NS</sub> ~ 10 km) and encompasses the binary orbit (a ~ 10<sup>6</sup> km for PSR B1913+16). Within r<sub>V</sub>, the scalar field is strongly screened, suppressing fifth-force contributions by factors of (R<sub>NS</sub>/r<sub>V</sub>)<sup>3</sup> ~ 10<sup>−9</sup>. The residual TEP effects on orbital dynamics are therefore below the 0.05% observational precision, rendering binary pulsar tests insensitive to the conformal coupling that generates GNSS correlations.
</p>

<p>
    Critically, pulsar timing measures orbital dynamics (gravitational sector, metric g<sub>μν</sub>), not clock correlations (matter sector, metric g̃<sub>μν</sub>). The two-metric structure allows the gravitational dynamics to remain GR-like while clock rates exhibit conformal modulation—these are distinct observables probing different sectors of the theory.
</p>

<p>
    Lunar Laser Ranging: LLR measures the Earth-Moon distance to millimeter precision, testing the equivalence principle through the Nordtvedt parameter η. The current bound η < 4.4 × 10<sup>−4</sup> constrains deviations from the strong equivalence principle. TEP satisfies this constraint through universal coupling: the conformal factor A(φ) couples identically to all matter fields, preserving the equivalence principle in the matter frame.
</p>

<p>
    The key distinction is between weak and strong equivalence principles. The weak EP (universality of free fall for test masses) is preserved exactly in TEP because all matter couples to the same metric g̃<sub>μν</sub>. The strong EP (self-gravitating bodies fall identically to test masses) can show deviations in scalar-tensor theories through composition-dependent couplings. However, TEP's universal conformal coupling ensures that the Nordtvedt parameter:
</p>

<div class="equation">
    $$\eta = 4\beta^2 - \gamma - 3$$
</div>

<p>
    remains within observational bounds for the coupling strength β ~ 10<sup>−3</sup> required to explain the GNSS correlation length. With γ ≈ 1 (Cassini constraint) and β ~ 10<sup>−3</sup>, the predicted Nordtvedt parameter is η ~ 4 × 10<sup>−6</sup>, well below the LLR bound.
</p>

<p>
    Furthermore, both Earth and Moon are within each other's screening radii (r<sub>V</sub><sup>Earth</sup> ~ 4,000 km, Earth-Moon distance ~ 384,000 km), placing the system in a regime where screening effects partially suppress the scalar field influence. The combination of universal coupling and screening ensures LLR compatibility while preserving the GNSS signal in the terrestrial environment where screening is less effective.
</p>

<h2>4.8 Relation to Established Scalar-Tensor Theory</h2>

<p>
    The TEP framework is not a novel field theory but rather a phenomenological application of well-established scalar-tensor gravity to precision timing. TEP with B = 0 and A(φ) = exp(2βφ/M<sub>Pl</sub>) reduces to Brans-Dicke gravity in the Jordan frame, with the coupling β related to the Brans-Dicke parameter ω<sub>BD</sub>. The screening mechanism employed (Vainshtein) arises naturally in the cubic Galileon sector of Horndeski gravity—the most general scalar-tensor theory with second-order equations of motion, ensuring freedom from Ostrogradsky instabilities. TEP's environmental screening is analogous to chameleon mechanisms but operates through derivative self-interactions rather than density-dependent mass. The two-metric structure is philosophically similar to Bekenstein's TeVeS, though TEP is more minimal, employing only a scalar field rather than scalar plus vector.
</p>

<p>
    The novelty of TEP lies not in the field theory but in the observational interpretation—specifically, the recognition that conformal coupling creates spatial correlations in clock rates that standard GNSS processing preserves while filtering amplitude information.
</p>

<h2>4.9 The Processing Filter Mechanism</h2>

<p>
    A critical insight explains both why the signal was missed for three decades and why it survives in the data. Standard GNSS processing is designed to optimize positioning accuracy by removing correlations, not to characterize them. The processing chain includes network adjustment (which removes common-mode signals), Kalman filtering (which smooths residuals toward zero-mean white noise), reference frame alignment (which forces consistency with ITRF, absorbing systematic offsets), and outlier rejection (which discards data points deviating from expected behavior).
</p>

<p>
    This architecture creates a natural filter: energetic (common-mode) signals are suppressed while geometric (differential) signals are preserved. Classical gravitational effects manifest as common-mode offsets—all clocks in a region experience similar tidal acceleration—and are therefore filtered. The TEP signal, by contrast, manifests as differential phase structure—the correlation between clock pairs depends on their geometric relationship—and is therefore preserved.
</p>

<p>
    This mechanism makes a specific prediction: GM/r² scaling should be absent in processed data because it is common-mode, while geometric signatures (anisotropy, CMB alignment) should survive because they are differential. The observations confirm both predictions. The processing filter is not a bug but a feature: it explains why the signal was categorized as systematic error rather than physical phenomenon, and why it can now be detected by examining the residuals that standard processing discards.

<h3>4.9.1 Mathematical Demonstration of Filter Selectivity</h3>

<p>
    The processing filter mechanism can be demonstrated mathematically by decomposing clock residuals into common-mode and differential components. Consider a network of N stations with clock residuals δt<sub>i</sub>(t) after initial processing. Standard GNSS processing applies a datum constraint that forces residuals to have zero spatial mean, removing common-mode offsets. In Fourier space, this constraint eliminates the k = 0 (monopole) component while preserving all k ≠ 0 (dipole, quadrupole, and higher) components that have zero spatial mean.
</p>

<p>
    Classical gravitational effects manifest as either GM/r² (force) or GM/r³ (tidal gradient) scaling. Tidal effects are k ≈ 2 (quadrupole) in spherical harmonic decomposition. However, standard GNSS processing explicitly models and subtracts known tidal terms (solid Earth tides, ocean loading, pole tide) using IERS conventions with sub-millimeter precision. The datum constraint removes residual common-mode offsets, while explicit tidal modeling eliminates the structured quadrupole components.
</p>

<p>
    The TEP signal survives not merely because it is differential (k ≠ 0), but because it represents an unmodeled scalar correlation function with exponential spatial form C(r) ∝ exp(−r/λ). This functional form does not match the spherical harmonic basis (Y<sub>lm</sub>) used in standard tidal modeling. Tidal corrections are parameterized as sums of spherical harmonics with known frequencies (diurnal, semidiurnal, long-period); the TEP correlation is a distance-dependent phase coherence that is not decomposable into the standard tidal basis. The processing removes what it models (tidal harmonics) but preserves what it does not model (exponential distance correlations in phase space).
</p>

<p>
    The TEP correlation structure manifests as phase coherence between station pairs. The analysis uses cross-spectral methods that are invariant under common-mode amplitude rescaling because they depend only on relative phases, not absolute amplitudes. The datum constraint removes monopole amplitude information but preserves the phase structure encoded in higher-order spatial modes. The exponential decay C(r) ∝ exp(−r/λ) reflects the two-point correlation function of the underlying φ field, which has nonzero spatial gradients and therefore survives network adjustment. (Detailed mathematical formulation is provided in Appendix B.)
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Prediction Verification:</strong> This mathematical framework makes two testable predictions, both confirmed by observations:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Null Prediction:</strong> Classical gravitational effects (GM/r² force and GM/r³ tidal gradient) should be absent in processed data because they are predominantly k = 0 and k ≈ 0 (long-wavelength) modes that the datum constraint removes. Observed: Neither GM/r² nor GM/r³ scaling detected (all p > 0.5).</li>
    <li><strong>Positive Prediction:</strong> Geometric anisotropy (EW/NS ratio) should survive because it represents a k ≠ 0 quadrupole moment with zero spatial mean but nonzero phase structure. Observed: EW/NS = 2.16 detected at p < 10<sup>−15</sup>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The persistence of both predictions in raw RINEX data processed with Single Point Positioning (which applies no network adjustment) confirms that the filter mechanism is a property of the signal's spatial structure, not an artifact of CODE/IGS processing algorithms.

<h2>4.10 Systematic Error Budget for Triangle Test</h2>
