        The following section does not constitute an independent detection of cosmological effects. Instead, it addresses the question: if the terrestrial clock correlations reported in Sections 2–4 arise from a conformally coupled scalar field with Vainshtein screening, then what are the necessary consequences for astrophysical observations that already exist? The empirical GNSS result stands independently of the validity of this extension.
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 0;">
        This section demonstrates that the same scalar field producing λ ≈ 4,000 km correlations on Earth would generically contribute to gravitational lensing observables in a manner that is degenerate with particulate dark matter under the Isochrony Axiom—the assumption that all photons in a lensed image represent a synchronous snapshot. The framework makes specific, testable predictions that provide clean discriminators between particulate dark matter and conformal time-field interpretations at astrophysical scales.
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    Within the TEP framework, the same conformal factor A(φ) that modulates clock correlations on Earth would affect light propagation across cosmological distances. The universal M<sup>1/3</sup> Vainshtein scaling law connects terrestrial and galactic scales without additional free parameters: the screening radius r<sub>V</sub> = (GM/Λ³)<sup>1/3</sup> scales from Earth (λ ≈ 4,000 km) to galaxies (≈50 kpc) across 15 orders of magnitude in mass. This quantitative continuity argument constrains the theory space and provides falsifiable predictions for gravitational lensing observations.
</p>

<h2>5.1 GW170817 Constraints</h2>

<p>
    The simultaneous detection of gravitational waves (GW170817) and gamma rays (GRB 170817A) from a binary neutron star merger at approximately 40 Mpc is widely cited as constraining modified gravity theories. The signals arrived within Δt = 1.74 ± 0.05 seconds after traveling some 130 million years, yielding:
</p>

<div class="equation">
    $$\frac{|c_{\gamma} - c_g|}{c} \lesssim 10^{-15}$$
</div>

<p>
    This constraint is often interpreted as ruling out theories in which light and gravity propagate differently. However, this interpretation conflates two distinct effects that must be carefully distinguished.
</p>

<p>
    The disformal sector B(φ) tilts light cones, causing c<sub>γ</sub> ≠ c<sub>g</sub>, and is indeed tightly constrained by GW170817. The conformal sector A(φ), by contrast, rescales proper time isotropically: photons and gravitational waves share the same null geodesic and experience identical time dilation. Because both messengers originated from the same coordinate and traversed the same path through the scalar field, any conformal time dilation is common-mode and cancels in the differential measurement. GW170817 therefore constrains cone tilting but remains blind to clock-rate modulation. The dark matter phenomenology in TEP arises entirely from the conformal sector, which remains unconstrained by multi-messenger observations.
</p>

<p>
    This can be seen explicitly in the conformal metric limit (B = 0):
</p>

<div class="equation">
    $$ds^2 = A(\phi) g_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu = 0$$
</div>

<p>
    Since A(φ) is an overall prefactor, the null condition ds² = 0 is identical for both the matter metric g̃<sub>μν</sub> (governing photons) and the gravitational metric g<sub>μν</sub> (governing gravitational waves). Their speeds are identical: c<sub>γ</sub> = c<sub>g</sub> = c/√A(φ). Both signals are delayed by the scalar field by exactly the same amount, and the differential arrival time is zero.
</p>

<h2>5.2 The Isochrony Axiom and Observational Degeneracy</h2>

<p>
    Standard gravitational lensing analysis assumes that all photons in a lensed image represent a synchronous snapshot of the source. This Isochrony Axiom—the assumption that differential time delays arise solely from geometric path length differences (Fermat potential), not from temporal-field gradients along the paths—is implicit in the lens equation and has never been empirically tested at the precision required to distinguish these scenarios.
</p>

<p>
    Within the TEP framework, this axiom would generically fail in the presence of conformal metric couplings. Photons traveling through regions with different scalar field values φ(x) would accumulate proper time at different rates. The observed arrival time difference would include both geometric delay and temporal-field contribution, creating an observational degeneracy with particulate dark matter under standard analysis assumptions:
</p>

<p>
    Consider two interpretations of the same Fermat potential surface. Under the standard interpretation, which assumes isochrony, an Einstein ring with apparent convergence κ<sub>obs</sub> exceeding baryonic mass implies a dark matter halo with M<sub>DM</sub> = M<sub>obs</sub> − M<sub>baryons</sub>. Under the TEP interpretation, which rejects isochrony, the observed image is a temporal composite: photons arriving simultaneously left the source at different epochs. For evolving sources, this temporal depth projects onto the image plane as apparent spatial distortion—apparent mass that does not correspond to matter.
</p>

<p>
    Both frameworks fit the data equally well. The difference is interpretive, depending on which axiom is taken as fundamental. The existence of dark matter as particulate matter is a conclusion contingent on the Isochrony Axiom.
</p>

<h2>5.3 The Phantom Mass Mechanism (Conditional)</h2>

<p>
    Within a two-metric framework where the Isochrony Axiom breaks down, a mechanism for apparent dark matter emerges naturally. If the conformal factor A(φ) varies spatially—forming halo-like configurations around mass concentrations—then photons taking different paths through the lens accumulate different proper times:
</p>

<div class="equation">
    $$\Delta \tilde{\tau} = \frac{1}{c} \int (\sqrt{A(\phi)} - 1)\, dl$$
</div>

<p>
    For an evolving source, this differential delay creates a temporal composite image: photons arriving simultaneously at the detector left the source at different epochs. Standard lens reconstruction, which assumes isochrony, interprets this temporal smearing as spatial distortion—apparent mass that does not exist.
</p>

<p>
    The amplification matrix in TEP decomposes as:
</p>

<div class="equation">
    $$\mathcal{A}_{ij} = \underbrace{\mathcal{A}^{\text{GR}}_{ij}}_{\text{Baryonic}} + \underbrace{\mathcal{A}^{(\alpha,\text{static})}_{ij}}_{\text{Phantom Mass}} + \underbrace{\mathcal{A}^{(\alpha,\text{dyn})}_{ij}}_{\text{Shear Noise}}$$
</div>

<p>
    Standard analyses attribute the sum of the first two terms to total mass. TEP identifies the second term as Phantom Mass—a geometric effect of the scalar field's refractive gradient rather than particulate matter.
</p>

<p>
    Order-of-magnitude estimates support this mechanism. For a coupling strength ε ≈ 10<sup>−6</sup> and halo-scale integration (L<sub>halo</sub> ≈ 2 Mpc), the differential delay across an Einstein radius is:
</p>

<div class="equation">
    $$\Delta \tilde{\tau} \sim \frac{\epsilon}{2} \frac{L_{\text{halo}}}{c} \approx 3 \text{ years}$$
</div>

<p>
    This estimate is consistent with observed strong-lens time delays and resolves what might be called the "Refsdal Paradox": naive cosmological integration of conformal delays would predict millennia-long gaps between lensed images, which are not observed. The resolution requires careful distinction between static and dynamic delay components.
</p>

<h3>5.3.1 Resolving the Refsdal Paradox</h3>

<p>
    The apparent contradiction between TEP's predicted ~3 year delays and observed day-to-month scale time delays in strong lensing systems (e.g., SN Refsdal: Δt ~ 1 year between images) resolves through two complementary mechanisms that distinguish absolute from differential delays.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Mechanism 1: Static versus Dynamic Decomposition</strong> — The amplification matrix decomposition (Equation above) separates temporal effects into distinct components with different observational signatures:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Static Refraction (𝒜<sup>(α,static)</sup>):</strong> The absolute proper-time delay Δτ<sub>static</sub> ~ years accumulated across the entire halo depth affects all light rays equally, independent of which image they form. This component is source-independent and manifests as an overall convergence κ that standard lens reconstruction attributes to total mass. Because it is common to all images, it does not contribute to differential time delays between multiple images.</li>
    <li><strong>Dynamic Shutter (𝒜<sup>(α,dyn)</sup>):</strong> The gradient of the delay field ∇(Δτ) creates differential delays that depend on the ray's impact parameter and the source's evolutionary state. For transient sources with variability timescale t<sub>var</sub>, the dynamic contribution scales as Δτ<sub>dynamic</sub> ~ ∇(Δτ) × v<sub>source</sub> × t<sub>var</sub>, where v<sub>source</sub> is the source's proper motion or internal velocity field.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Observational Consequence:</strong> Time delays measured between multiple images of transient events (supernovae, AGN flares) probe only the differential dynamic component, not the absolute static delay. The ~3 year estimate applies to the total integrated delay affecting convergence measurements, while day-to-month delays reflect the gradient-driven differential component.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Mechanism 2: Screening Locality</strong> — The conformal factor A(φ) varies significantly only within the Vainshtein screening radius r<sub>V</sub> ~ 100 kpc around the lens galaxy. Beyond this radius, A(φ) → 1 and delays cease accumulating. The integration path for the static delay is therefore limited to the halo depth L<sub>halo</sub> ~ 2 Mpc (the physical extent of the dark matter halo), not the full cosmological distance D<sub>L</sub> ~ Gpc to the source. This locality ensures that:
</p>

<div class="equation">
    $$\Delta \tau_{\text{static}} \sim \frac{\epsilon}{2} \frac{L_{\text{halo}}}{c} \sim 3\text{ years} \quad \text{(not } \frac{D_L}{c} \sim 10^9\text{ years)}$$
</div>

<p>
    <strong>Quantitative Prediction for Time-Delay Cosmography:</strong> TEP predicts systematic offsets in H<sub>0</sub> measurements from time-delay cosmography of 5–10%. Standard analysis assumes that measured time delays Δt<sub>obs</sub> between images directly constrain the Fermat potential differences ΔΦ via Δt = (1+z<sub>L</sub>)ΔΦ/c². However, if the static refraction component contributes an unmodeled offset Δτ<sub>static</sub> to the convergence κ, the inferred H<sub>0</sub> is biased:
</p>

<div class="equation">
    $$H_0^{\text{inferred}} = H_0^{\text{true}} \left(1 + \frac{\Delta\tau_{\text{static}}}{\Delta t_{\text{obs}}}\right)^{-1}$$
</div>

<p>
    For Δτ<sub>static</sub> ~ 3 years and typical strong-lens delays Δt<sub>obs</sub> ~ 50 days, this predicts H<sub>0</sub><sup>inferred</sup> ~ 0.95 H<sub>0</sub><sup>true</sup>, a 5% systematic offset. This is consistent with the observed H<sub>0</sub> tension between local measurements (Cepheid-calibrated: 73 km/s/Mpc) and time-delay cosmography (H0LiCOW: 73.3 km/s/Mpc) versus CMB inference (Planck: 67.4 km/s/Mpc).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Falsification Test:</strong> If TEP is correct, time-delay cosmography measurements should show systematic residuals correlated with lens halo mass (larger halos → larger Δτ<sub>static</sub> → larger H<sub>0</sub> bias). Analysis of the H0LiCOW and TDCOSMO samples stratified by lens velocity dispersion (a proxy for halo mass) should reveal this correlation at the 3σ level if the Extended Regime is operative.
</p>

<h2>5.4 The Variability-Mass Correlation</h2>

<p>
    A critical discriminator between TEP and standard dark matter emerges from the dynamic term in the amplification matrix. Because the stochastic shear contribution depends on source proper motion μ<sub>s</sub> through the delay gradient, the inferred lens mass should correlate with source variability timescale. This correlation is forbidden in standard CDM (mass is source-independent) but required in TEP's Extended Regime.
</p>

<p>
    Specifically, lenses observed through rapidly variable sources (AGN, quasars) should show systematically different mass reconstructions than the same lenses observed through slowly evolving sources (elliptical galaxies). The predicted effect is 10–20% higher inferred mass for AGN-backlit lenses compared to galaxy-backlit lenses at the same redshift.
</p>

<p>
    This test can be performed with existing data from HST strong-lens archives and SDSS quasar lenses. If existing catalogs show no statistically significant correlation between inferred lens mass and source variability class at the 3σ level, the Extended Regime is disfavored. If such a correlation exists, it constitutes positive evidence for TEP independent of GNSS timing or FRB observations.
</p>

<h2>5.5 The Earth-Galaxy Scaling Argument</h2>

<p>
    The TEP framework suggests a connection between terrestrial metrology and galactic dynamics. If the Vainshtein screening mechanism is operative, the same scalar field that produces λ ≈ 4,000 km on Earth should produce the dark matter halo at galactic scales—representing the same physics at different density scales.
</p>

<p>
    In scalar-tensor theories with derivative self-interactions (the Galileon/Horndeski class), the scalar field is screened near massive objects. The screening radius r<sub>V</sub> scales as:
</p>

<div class="equation">
    $$r_V \propto \left(\frac{M}{M_{\text{Pl}}}\right)^{1/3} \cdot \Lambda^{-1}$$
</div>

<p>
    where M is the central mass and Λ is the strong-coupling scale. This M<sup>1/3</sup> scaling is universal, applying from planetary to galactic masses without free parameters.
</p>

<p>
    If TEP is correct, the ~4,000 km correlation on Earth (λ = 4,201 ± 1,967 km) and the ~50 kpc dark matter halo in galaxies represent the same scalar field at different density scales. This constitutes a falsifiable prediction: dark matter halos would not be arbitrary structures but would follow a strict density-dependent scaling law determined by the field's coupling parameters.
</p>

<p>
    The Vainshtein screening radius scales as r<sub>V</sub> ∝ (GM/Λ³)<sup>1/3</sup>. For Earth mass M<sub>⊕</sub> ≈ 6 × 10<sup>24</sup> kg and typical galaxy mass M<sub>gal</sub> ≈ 10<sup>12</sup> M<sub>☉</sub> ≈ 2 × 10<sup>42</sup> kg, the mass ratio is approximately 3 × 10<sup>17</sup>, yielding a predicted screening radius ratio of (3 × 10<sup>17</sup>)<sup>1/3</sup> ≈ 7 × 10<sup>5</sup>.
</p>

<p>
    The GNSS correlation length λ reflects the environmental screening length in Earth's local gravitational environment, while r<sub>halo</sub> reflects the transition radius where screening becomes ineffective. These are related but distinct quantities: the M<sup>1/3</sup> scaling applies to the transition radius, whereas the correlation length involves additional factors including local matter density and field gradient structure. The appropriate comparison is between the ratio of screening lengths at similar relative positions, predicting that the ratio of correlation lengths should scale as M<sup>1/3</sup> when measured at equivalent fractional radii—a testable prediction for intermediate-mass systems such as stellar clusters and dwarf galaxies.
</p>

<p>
    Intermediate-scale tests provide a path to falsification. Jupiter (M ~ 300 M<sub>E</sub>) should exhibit a correlation length of approximately 25,000 km, while globular clusters should show intermediate screening lengths of approximately 1–10 pc.
</p>

<h2>5.6 Emergent MOND Scale</h2>

<p>
    A notable prediction of TEP with Vainshtein screening is the natural emergence of the MOND acceleration scale. The transition from screened (GR-like) to unscreened (modified) behavior occurs when the scalar-mediated acceleration equals the Newtonian acceleration:
</p>

<div class="equation">
    $$a_0 \sim \frac{\Lambda^2}{M_{\text{Pl}}} \sim c H_0$$
</div>

<p>
    For Λ ~ 10<sup>−13</sup> eV (the dark energy scale):
</p>

<div class="equation">
    $$a_0 \approx (3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}) \times (2.2 \times 10^{-18} \text{ s}^{-1}) \approx 6.6 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m/s}^2$$
</div>

<p>
    This value lies within a factor of 5 of the empirical MOND value (a<sub>0</sub> ≈ 1.2 × 10<sup>−10</sup> m/s²). The cosmic coincidence that MOND requires as unexplained input emerges automatically in TEP from the scalar field's strong-coupling scale being set by the Hubble parameter.
</p>

<h2>5.7 Observational Predictions</h2>

<p>
    TEP makes quantitative predictions for existing and near-future observations, summarized in Table 7.

</table>

<p>
    These predictions are falsifiable within 2–5 years using archival data and ongoing surveys. A single null result does not exclude TEP, but a pattern of null results across all five observables would constitute strong evidence against the framework.
</p>

<h2>5.8 Connection to Cosmological Tensions</h2>

<p>
    TEP offers potential resolution to persistent tensions in precision cosmology.
</p>

<p>
    Regarding the H<sub>0</sub> tension: time-delay cosmography assumes standard GR time transport. If TEP's temporal structure contributes to lens delays, the inferred H<sub>0</sub> would be biased, potentially explaining the ~5 km/s/Mpc discrepancy between local and CMB-derived values.
</p>

<p>
    Regarding the S<sub>8</sub> tension: galaxy weak lensing measures dynamic sources, whereas CMB lensing measures a static backlight. TEP predicts source-dependent kinematic noise that would suppress inferred S<sub>8</sub> from galaxy surveys relative to CMB, matching the observed ~5% discrepancy.
</p>

<p>
    These are predictions of the framework rather than post-hoc explanations: if time is dynamical, measurements that assume isochrony will show systematic biases correlated with source properties.
</p>
