        Analysis of 25.3 years of GNSS timing data (2000–2025) reveals a persistent, distance-structured correlation in global atomic clock networks that tests an empirically untested assumption of general relativity: the global integrability of proper time. Examination of 165.2 million station pairs from 474 unique receivers demonstrates a spatial correlation signal decaying exponentially with distance (λ = 4,201 ± 1,967 km, R² = 0.92–0.97 across three independent analysis centers). These findings emerge from a systematic five-paper research program: theoretical framework development with quantitative predictions (Paper 0), multi-center validation across independent processing pipelines (Paper 1), 25-year longitudinal analysis enabling long-period geophysical detection (Paper 2), raw data confirmation eliminating processing artifacts (Paper 3), and cosmological extension connecting terrestrial correlations to dark matter phenomenology through gravitational lensing (Paper 4).

        Seven statistically independent signatures emerge with joint probability p ≈ 2×10<sup>−27</sup> (>10σ): exponential spatial decay; East-West/North-South anisotropy (ratio 2.16, p < 10<sup>−15</sup>); orbital velocity coupling (r = −0.888, 5.1σ); alignment with the Cosmic Microwave Background dipole (18.2° separation, 5,570× variance ratio over galactic motion); planetary event responses (56/156 significant at ≥2σ); 18.6-year lunar nutation coupling (R² = 0.641); and semiannual nutation coupling (R² = 0.904). Raw RINEX validation using Single Point Positioning with broadcast ephemerides achieves 100% detection rate across 72 metric combinations (t-statistics up to 112, Cohen's d up to 0.304), excluding processing artifacts as the origin. The network's selectivity profile—sensitive to velocity-dependent dynamics while blind to GM/r² scaling and solar rotation—characterizes it as an inertial interferometer measuring correlation geometry rather than a gravimeter measuring Newtonian force.

        These observations match a priori predictions of the Temporal Equivalence Principle, a bi-metric scalar-tensor framework in which proper time is a dynamical field governed by a conformal factor A(φ) = exp(2βφ/M<sub>Pl</sub>). The observed correlation length corresponds to a scalar field mass m<sub>φ</sub> ≈ (4.34–5.93)×10<sup>−14</sup> eV/c², consistent with Vainshtein screening at the dark energy scale Λ ~ 10<sup>−13</sup> eV. The framework preserves local Lorentz invariance while predicting global path-dependent synchronization through spatial correlations in the φ field. Critically, the conformal sector responsible for clock-rate modulation remains unconstrained by GW170817, which bounds only disformal (cone-tilting) effects.

        If validated through independent replication, TEP implies that dark matter phenomenology in gravitational lensing arises from temporal-field gradients rather than particulate matter—the projection of differential proper-time accumulation onto observations that assume the Isochrony Axiom. The 4,000 km correlation on Earth and the 50 kpc dark matter halo in galaxies represent the same scalar field at different density scales, connected by the universal M<sup>1/3</sup> Vainshtein scaling law. Explicit falsification criteria include: failure of independent groups to replicate the raw carrier-phase signal; correlation length falling outside the 500–20,000 km range; confirmation that the signal arises from ephemeris artifacts rather than physical clock correlations (via Satellite Laser Ranging validation); and null synchronization holonomy in closed-loop triangular time-transfer experiments.
