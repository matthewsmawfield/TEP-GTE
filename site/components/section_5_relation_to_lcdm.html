<h2>5.9 Relation to ΛCDM</h2>

<p>
    The standard ΛCDM cosmological model fits observational data with remarkable precision. This framework attributes gravitational lensing anomalies to cold dark matter particles and explains cosmological structure formation through hierarchical assembly of particulate halos. ΛCDM is empirically successful and theoretically well-motivated.
</p>

<p>
    TEP does not claim that ΛCDM is incorrect. Rather, TEP proposes that the same observational phenomena can be reinterpreted under a different axiom set. The key distinction is operational, not observational at current precision:
</p>

<ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
    <li><strong>ΛCDM interpretation:</strong> Gravitational lensing mass reconstructions directly measure matter distribution. Excess convergence beyond baryonic mass indicates particulate dark matter with density profile ρ<sub>DM</sub>(r). The Isochrony Axiom (all photons in an image represent a synchronous snapshot) is implicitly assumed and never tested.</li>
    
    <li><strong>TEP interpretation:</strong> Gravitational lensing mass reconstructions measure the effective Fermat potential, which includes both matter distribution and temporal-field gradients. Excess convergence can arise from differential proper-time accumulation along different light paths. The Isochrony Axiom is empirically testable through achromatic timing residuals in lensed transients.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Both frameworks fit existing lensing data because they make identical predictions for static sources observed under the assumption of isochrony. The degeneracy is broken by observations that probe temporal structure:
</p>

<ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
    <li><strong>Lensed fast radio bursts:</strong> ΛCDM predicts achromatic residuals (after plasma correction) consistent with zero. TEP predicts achromatic residuals at the 0.1–10 ms level arising from differential temporal-field accumulation (Section 5.4).</li>
    
    <li><strong>Variable source lensing:</strong> ΛCDM predicts inferred lens mass is independent of source variability timescale. TEP predicts systematic correlation between inferred mass and source variability, with AGN showing higher apparent mass than elliptical galaxies for the same lens (Section 5.4).</li>
    
    <li><strong>CMB vs. galaxy lensing S<sub>8</sub>:</strong> ΛCDM predicts convergence of CMB-inferred and galaxy-inferred S<sub>8</sub> as systematics are controlled. TEP predicts persistent tension arising from kinematic noise in galaxy surveys that is absent in CMB (static source).</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The frameworks compete rather than contradict. ΛCDM remains the default interpretation given its theoretical maturity and empirical success. TEP offers an alternative interpretation that becomes distinguishable through specific tests designed to probe temporal structure in lensing observations. Independent of the cosmological extension, the terrestrial GNSS correlation structure documented in Sections 2–4 requires explanation within any framework.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Falsification asymmetry:</strong> Null results in the tests above would exclude TEP's cosmological extension while leaving ΛCDM intact. Positive results would require reinterpretation of dark matter phenomenology but would not exclude particulate dark matter in all contexts—only in regimes where temporal-field gradients dominate the lensing signal. This asymmetry reflects TEP's status as a challenger framework rather than an established paradigm.
