<h2>3. Validation</h2>

<p>
    Extraordinary claims require extraordinary validation. This section systematically addresses the most plausible artifact hypotheses, demonstrating that the signal survives each challenge.
</p>

<h2>3.1 Processing Artifact Hypothesis</h2>

<p>
    The most immediate concern is that the signal arises from sophisticated processing chains—network adjustments, Kalman filtering, or integer ambiguity resolution. To address this possibility, raw RINEX observation files were processed using Single Point Positioning with broadcast ephemerides only, representing the simplest possible processing chain and one entirely independent of the network adjustments employed by CODE, IGS, and ESA.
</p>

<p>
    The raw RINEX validation dataset comprises 539 stations over three years (2022–2024), totaling 1.17 billion pair-samples. The signal is detected in all 72 metric combinations tested (100% detection rate), with mean R² = 0.93. Directional anisotropy matches the CODE findings, with East-West exceeding North-South by 2–22% at short distances (<500 km). A critical audit confirms this is robust to distance bias: E-W pairs are 13 km longer than N-S pairs (a bias <em>against</em> the signal), and distance-matching strengthens the ratio.
</p>

<p>
    The correlation length in raw data (λ ≈ 700–1,100 km) is shorter than in precise products (λ ≈ 4,000 km), consistent with ionospheric noise masking the long-range structure. When ionospheric effects are removed (Ionofree mode), the raw correlation length increases, supporting a "Ladder of Precision" where the signal scale converges toward the CODE benchmark as noise is mitigated. Orbital velocity coupling is detected at r = −0.763 (5.4σ) in multi-GNSS mode, and CMB alignment yields RA = 188°, Dec = −5° (20.0° from the CMB dipole), consistent with the 25-year analysis. The signal therefore exists in the fundamental observables and cannot be attributed to processing artifacts.
</p>

<h2>3.2 Ionospheric Hypothesis</h2>

<p>
    If the signal were ionospheric in origin—driven by solar activity modulating electron density along signal paths—it should correlate with solar cycle variations. The 25-year baseline spans Solar Cycles 23, 24, and 25, encompassing three solar maxima (2001, 2014, 2024) and two deep minima, providing substantial leverage for this test.
</p>

<p>
    The correlation between the signal and the Solar Flux Index is r ≈ 0, indicating no significant relationship. The correlation length λ remains stable across solar maxima within uncertainty bounds. Moreover, the signal persists in the dual-frequency ionosphere-free L1+L2 combination (λ = 1,069 km, R² = 0.969), and excluding high-ionosphere periods improves the signal by 21–23%. This last observation indicates that the ionosphere suppresses rather than creates the correlation. The signal is therefore not ionospheric in origin.
</p>

<h2>3.3 Geomagnetic Hypothesis</h2>

<p>
    If the signal were driven by geomagnetic storms affecting clock electronics or signal propagation, it should vary systematically with geomagnetic activity. Stratification by GFZ Kp index data across all 72 metric combinations yields median Δλ ≈ −1% at the primary threshold (Kp &lt; 3 versus Kp ≥ 3), with 60 of 72 tests falling within ±5% across all station filters and processing modes. No systematic deviation appears at higher storm thresholds (Kp ≥ 4, Kp ≥ 5). The signal is therefore geomagnetically invariant.
</p>

<h2>3.4 Tropospheric Hypothesis</h2>

<p>
    If the signal were tropospheric in origin—driven by water vapor or pressure variations that correlate spatially—stations at high altitude (with thinner atmospheric columns) should show systematically different correlation lengths than sea-level stations.
</p>

<p>
    Analysis of 360 regressions spanning global and latitude-controlled altitude quintiles reveals that only 3.1% exhibit p &lt; 0.05 slopes, consistent with chance expectation. The Q5/Q1 ratio (highest to lowest altitude quintile) has median 0.97 (IQR 0.76–1.27), indicating that low-altitude and high-altitude stations yield statistically indistinguishable λ values.
</p>

<p>
    The tropospheric column depth varies by approximately 20–30% between sea-level and high-altitude stations. If the correlation structure were tropospheric, one would expect systematic increase in λ at high altitude, latitude dependence correlated with tropopause height, and seasonal modulation correlated with monsoon patterns. None of these signatures are observed. The signal is altitude-invariant, consistent with a phenomenon operating at gravitational potential scales (~6,400 km) rather than atmospheric scales (~10 km).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Comprehensive Validation Summary:</strong> The altitude independence test represents one component of a broader validation framework spanning 388 independent statistical tests across multiple analysis families. False Discovery Rate correction (FDR-BH: 52.3%, Hierarchical Empirical Bayes: 39.7%, Bonferroni: 40.0%) demonstrates robustness against multiple comparison artifacts. This extensive validation, combined with cross-center consistency (coefficient of variation 18.2% across CODE, IGS, ESA), establishes that the observed correlations survive rigorous scrutiny across independent processing pipelines, environmental conditions, and statistical frameworks.
</p>

<h2>3.5 Long-Period Stability</h2>

<p>
    If the signal were a transient artifact of the analysis window, it would not persist across the full 25.3-year baseline or couple coherently to long-period geophysical phenomena.
</p>

<p>
    The data reveal clear coupling to multiple geophysical cycles. The 18.6-year lunar nutation shows R² = 0.641 (p &lt; 10<sup>−8</sup>), with 1.4 complete cycles observed. The semiannual nutation shows R² = 0.904 (p &lt; 10<sup>−20</sup>), with over 50 complete cycles. The Chandler wobble (433 days) shows R² = 0.096 with phase stability of 0.72 across more than 21 cycles. Core signatures—correlation length, anisotropy, and orbital coupling—remain consistent across the full 25-year span. The signal is therefore temporally stable across multiple geophysical cycles.
</p>

<h2>3.6 Most Plausible Remaining Conventional Explanation</h2>

<p>
    The strongest remaining conventional hypothesis is that the observed correlations arise from a presently unmodeled, long-baseline GNSS systematic that survives both network adjustment and raw SPP processing. This section addresses this hypothesis with intellectual honesty: while extensive validation constrains conventional explanations, it cannot definitively exclude all possible systematics.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>The Hypothesis:</strong> A sophisticated, distance-dependent systematic error exists in GNSS observations that: (1) produces exponential decay with λ ≈ 4,000 km; (2) exhibits East-West/North-South anisotropy ratio of 2.16; (3) couples to Earth's orbital velocity with r = −0.888; (4) aligns with the CMB dipole to 18.2°; (5) responds to planetary configurations without mass scaling; (6) couples to 18.6-year lunar nutation and semiannual nutation; (7) survives independent processing by CODE, IGS, and ESA; (8) persists in raw RINEX data processed with broadcast ephemerides only; and (9) appears identically across 72 independent metric combinations with 100% detection rate.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Constraints from Validation:</strong> Each validation step constrains this hypothesis without claiming impossibility:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Multi-center consistency (R² = 0.92–0.97, CV = 18.2%):</strong> The systematic must be present in three independent processing pipelines using different algorithms, software, and analysis centers. This excludes center-specific artifacts but does not exclude systematics inherent to GNSS observation geometry or satellite constellation design.</li>
    <li><strong>Raw RINEX validation (100% detection, t-stats up to 112):</strong> The systematic must survive Single Point Positioning with broadcast ephemerides, which processes each station independently without network adjustment. This excludes network-adjustment artifacts but does not exclude systematics in the broadcast ephemeris itself (the "ephemeris loophole" addressed in Section 6.3.1.1).</li>
    <li><strong>25-year temporal stability:</strong> The systematic must persist across satellite constellation changes, hardware upgrades, and processing methodology evolution spanning 1.4 complete cycles of the 18.6-year lunar nutation. This excludes transient artifacts but does not exclude systematics tied to fundamental GNSS geometry.</li>
    <li><strong>CMB frame alignment (5,570× variance ratio):</strong> The systematic must preferentially align with the cosmological rest frame rather than galactic motion, solar motion, or ecliptic plane. This is geometrically difficult to explain through satellite constellation geometry but not impossible if some unrecognized coupling exists between GNSS observation geometry and Earth's motion through the CMB frame.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Remaining Possibility:</strong> The most plausible remaining conventional explanation is a systematic tied to the fundamental geometry of GNSS satellite constellations that couples to Earth's motion through space in a way not previously recognized. Such a systematic would need to produce all observed signatures through a single coherent mechanism—a requirement that becomes increasingly implausible as the number of independent signatures grows, but cannot be definitively excluded without independent validation through non-GNSS methods (SLR, triangle holonomy test).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Path to Resolution:</strong> Definitive exclusion of this hypothesis requires: (1) SLR validation (Section 6.3.1.1) to close the ephemeris loophole; (2) multi-constellation cross-validation showing identical λ across GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou; and (3) triangle holonomy test (Section 6.3.3) providing direct measurement of synchronization non-closure. Until these tests are completed, the possibility of an unrecognized GNSS systematic, however implausible given the convergence of evidence, cannot be completely excluded.
</p>

<h2>3.7 Preliminary SLR Evidence</h2>

<p>
    Satellite Laser Ranging provides an independent validation pathway for TEP predictions. While dedicated SLR analysis remains a priority for future work (Section 6.3.1.1), existing anomalies in the SLR literature exhibit signatures consistent with the geometric screening effects predicted by TEP.
</p>

<h3>3.7.1 The Blue-Sky Effect</h3>

<p>
    SLR stations systematically measure Earth's crust as depressed during clear-sky (high atmospheric pressure) conditions compared to microwave-based techniques. This phenomenon, termed the "Blue-Sky effect," produces vertical displacements of 1.1–4.4 mm across the global SLR network, with the average effect of 1.1 mm corresponding to a scale discrepancy of approximately 0.2 ppb relative to Earth's radius. The maximum displacement of 4.4 mm occurs at inland stations in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
</p>

<p>
    The standard explanation attributes this effect to atmospheric pressure loading—elastic deformation of Earth's crust under varying atmospheric mass. This explanation is well-established in the geodetic literature and successfully accounts for the observed magnitudes. The Blue-Sky effect is noted here not as evidence against the standard model, but as an observation whose phenomenology (systematic vertical offsets correlated with atmospheric conditions) is also consistent with TEP's prediction of path-dependent proper time accumulation. Distinguishing between these interpretations would require dedicated analysis beyond the scope of this preliminary survey.
</p>

<h3>3.7.2 Persistent Range Bias Residuals</h3>

<p>
    Despite decades of refinement, high-performance SLR stations exhibit persistent systematic residuals at the 10–20 mm level that resist conventional explanation. Historical analysis of the NASA MOBLAS network documented centimeter-level systematic biases through collocation analysis, with survey uncertainties and apparent system delays showing discrepancies up to 20 mm between calibration targets. These residuals persist even after corrections for tropospheric delay, relativistic effects, tidal loading, and hardware calibration.
</p>

<p>
    The International Laser Ranging Service Analysis Standing Committee continues to investigate station-satellite-specific range biases for LAGEOS satellites, noting that range biases correlate strongly with station height over short periods—a correlation that may influence SLR's ability to provide absolute scale. The magnitude of these unexplained residuals (10–20 mm) falls within the range predicted by TEP for proper time delays accumulated through Earth's gravitational screening field.
</p>

<h3>3.7.3 Elevation-Dependent Systematics</h3>

<p>
    SLR residuals exhibit elevation- and azimuth-dependent errors that standard tropospheric mapping functions fail to fully remove. At low elevation angles, these errors can reach 20 mm after mapping from zenith values. Recent work has demonstrated that estimating tropospheric biases absorbs these elevation-dependent errors but does not explain their physical origin.
</p>

<p>
    From the TEP perspective, elevation dependence maps directly to path length through Earth's screening field. A signal decaying with characteristic length λ ≈ 4,200 km would produce precisely the elevation-dependent curve that standard atmospheric models fail to capture—the residual structure represents not tropospheric error but geometric screening accumulated along the signal path.
</p>

<h3>3.7.4 Interpretation and Caveats</h3>

<p>
    These SLR anomalies are presented as preliminary supporting evidence rather than independent confirmation. The geodetic community has proposed conventional explanations for each phenomenon: atmospheric pressure loading for the Blue-Sky effect, hardware calibration issues for range biases, and tropospheric modeling limitations for elevation dependence. TEP does not claim these explanations are incorrect—rather, that the same observations admit an alternative interpretation consistent with geometric screening of proper time.
</p>

<p>
    Definitive SLR validation requires dedicated analysis of LAGEOS residuals stratified by elevation angle, with explicit comparison to TEP predictions. The publicly available data from stations such as Yarragadee (Australia) provide immediate opportunity for such analysis. If TEP is correct, plotting SLR residuals against elevation angle should reveal the characteristic exponential decay structure with λ consistent with GNSS-derived values.

<h2>3.8 Why the Signal Was Not Previously Identified</h2>

<p>
    The correlation structure documented here has been present in GNSS data since the network's inception but was systematically removed by processing algorithms optimized for positioning accuracy rather than fundamental physics characterization. Three factors explain why it was not identified earlier.
</p>

<p>
    Standard GNSS processing is designed to eliminate correlations, not to characterize them. The processing chain includes network adjustment (which removes common-mode signals), Kalman filtering (which smooths residuals toward zero-mean white noise), reference frame alignment (which forces consistency with ITRF, absorbing systematic offsets), and outlier rejection (which discards data points deviating from expected behavior).
</p>

<p>
    The correlation structure detected in this analysis is precisely what these algorithms are designed to remove. From the perspective of positioning accuracy, this is appropriate—the signal degrades positioning solutions. From the perspective of fundamental physics, however, it constitutes signal that reveals underlying structure.
</p>

<p>
    The present analysis examines the residuals that standard processing discards, employing phase-coherent cross-spectral methods that preserve correlation structure. The signal was present throughout the history of GNSS operation but was categorized as systematic error rather than physical phenomenon.
